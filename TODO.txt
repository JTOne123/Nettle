TODO:
-----

- Environment Variables
	- Create environment variables that can be accessed in the template by name, these can be loaded on the fly by an environment variable provider (e.g. web.config or appsettings.json)
	- This would be useful for scenarios such as specifying an endpoint URL that changes across deployments but we don't want to have multiple versions of the template

- Fix: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SqlClient, Version=4.4.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
	- E.g. {{var results1 = @ExecuteQuery("Demo", query1)}}

Low Priority:
-------------

- Create IStringifier interface and integrate into INettleResolver so we can get all formatters for different types (e.g. XmlDocument)

- Add support for caching
